They also value having a job and a family. Lack of Food, Firewood, Water or a place to sleep will cause a decrease in the parameter. Mood can also be influenced by random Events.\r\n\r\nThe level of Mood influences how eagerly the inhabitants perform their daily routines. Its high or low level affects the workers' speed of production, the stallholders' pace of trading and the rate at which builders repair structures. The bonus values vary from -20% when the Mood is -100% to +20% when the happiness reaches 100%.",

    "SmallTalk_10_FS_MTF": "Once, I had a dream that I was chased by an army of my old trousers. I'm sure I've never had that many pairs, but I didn't have a chance to point that out to them because they were singing about the revenge they wanted to take on me for buying the new ones.",
    "SmallTalk_04_RM_MTF": "Once, a merchant brought some strange orange fruits with a very thick skin. I dream about their taste all the time. One day I'll go south and grow them.",

    "SmallTalk_14_SB_MTF": "People asking too many questions. But don't worry, I like yours.",

    "Compliment_07_FTM": "Real men like you are hard to find these days.",
    "Compliment_07_FS_MTF": "Real? And what if I'm just a figment of your imagination?",
    "Compliment_09_SB_MTF": "Said a man to his wife after learning she was expecting twins.",
    "SmallTalk_05_FS_MTF": "Seven brothers. We're all named the same because our old pa's memory was like a sieve. Then my sister was born. Ma gave her a different name, but he keeps calling her like all the boys.",

    "SmallTalk_09_SB_MTF": "Summer, I guess. I hate heat.",

    "Compliment_10_FS_MTF": "Thank you. I've also never met anyone as annoying as me.",
    "Compliment_13_BB_MTF": "Thank you. My mother taught me that a man should not only be tough but also gentle. A delicate touch helps me soothe a chicken, before I snap its neck.",
    "Compliment_08_RM_MTF": "Thanks. Recently, I was thinking about building something that could protect houses against theft and unwanted guests.",
    "SmallTalk_11_FS_MTF": "That one day I'll carry my jokes too far and offend someone special to me.",
    "Strange_02_BB_MTF": "That's a very... specific vision. But I believe that we should face the consequences of our actions.",
    "FunFact_05_RM_MTF": "That's fascinating. Don't you think that it could be great if there was a language made up only of gestures and no words for people who can't talk?",
    "Compliment_08_FS_MTF": "That's great, because there's a huge bear behind you, waiting for us to end our conversation so he can eat you. But do not fret my lady! Just don't look back, move a bit closer and keep talking.",
    "FunFact_01_RM_MTF": "That's interesting. I'm curious how sheep coped before they were domesticated and there was no one to shear them.",
    "Opinions_05_SB_MTF": "That's maybe because she has never experienced what poverty feels like.",
    "Compliment_11_SB_MTF": "That's not just work, girl.",
    "Compliment_09_BB_MTF": "That's quite... surprising.",
    "Gossip_04_FTM": "The herbalist's hut burned not so long ago. Some people say that's because he was conducting some experiments there, and others say that someone burned his house down.",

    "Opinions_04_BB_MTF": "The whole idea of wars is so stupid. People lose their lives and belongings for nothing.",
    "Opinions_04_SB_MTF": "The world is a cruel place. People would come up with something even worse. I'm sure of it.",
    "Compliment_04_FS_MTF": "Then no work would be done.",
    "Compliment_02_SB_MTF": "There are more areas in which I never fail.",
    "SmallTalk_11_RM_MTF": "There is a creature that has been haunting me in my dreams since I can remember. It looks like a violet mountain that freezes everything on its way and its yellowish eyes are piercing my soul... But my biggest fear is that none of my dreams and plans will ever come true, and I'll die without achieving anything.",
    "SmallTalk_03_SB_MTF": "There is nothing better than stalking people for fun. You should try it.",
    "Gossip_03_FTM": "There is one guy who collects teeth. Supposedly, he's got more than two hundred!",
    "Romantic_10_FS_MTF": "There is one ingenious and a bit radical solution to this problem, but it may blow your mind. Are you ready? So listen. Don't go away so often.",
    "Compliment_10_SB_MTF": "They haven't seen the crap I've seen.",
    "Opinions_02_BB_MTF": "They're quite a rarity, aren't they?",
    "Strange_02_FS_MTF": "Think about how many pranks we could do and how many strange things we could try and completely get away with it!",
    "Opinions_01_RM_MTF": "This idea has some potential but it would only make sense if they could fight against other female knights becuse men will always have an unfair advantage. Maybe in the future there will be some inventions that can even the odds but for now I can't see it working.",
    "Strange_04_RM_MTF": "Training pigeons! That's a great idea! I'm not sure if stealing would be my first choice, but still...",
    "SmallTalk_05_BB_MTF": "Two sisters and one brother. I was the oldest, so I had to grow up faster and look after them.",
    "FunFact_02_FS_MTF": "Uuu... Let's hunt some deer then, babe.",
    "SmallTalk_09_BB_MTF": "We need all of the seasons, but hm... Maybe winter? Snow can be quite a nuisance.",
    "Romantic_04_BB_MTF": "We should put some blankets on the ground first to not get cold and check if there are no anthills nearby but I believe that night should be for sleeping.",
    "Strange_01_BB_MTF": "Well, I don't think we have much choice in that matter, do we? But if I could choose, I would probably go for dying from old age, surrounded by the closest ones.",
    "Compliment_02_RM_MTF": "Well, people often laugh at my plans and visions.",
    "Compliment_01_BB_MTF": "Well, then, I would say that you haven't met that many people in your life.",
    "SmallTalk_07_FTM": "What are your favourite animals?",
    "SmallTalk_02_FTM": "What brought you here?",
    "Compliment_07_SB_MTF": "What can I say? Some things force you to man up.",
    "SmallTalk_11_FTM": "What is your biggest fear?",
    "SmallTalk_14_FTM": "What makes your blood boil?",
    "SmallTalk_13_FTM": "What's your biggest dream?",

    "SmallTalk_09_FTM": "What's your least favourite season of the year?",
    "SmallTalk_14_RM_MTF": "When I keep failing at doing something. That's awfully annoying, don't you think?",
    "Romantic_04_FS_MTF": "When I was a kid, I thought that stars are just fireflies that stuck up to the sky.",
    "Compliment_12_RM_MTF": "When I'm devoted to an idea or a woman, I don't look sideways.",
    "SmallTalk_15_RM_MTF": "When people don't want to listen to me and want to finish our conversation as fast as possible.",
    "SmallTalk_06_FTM": "Where do you come from? Tell me something about your birthplace.",
    "Strange_04_SB_MTF": "Why can't I choose alcohol?",
    "Opinions_03_FS_MTF": "Why don't we ban alcohol altogether? Why don't we ban water as well?",
    "Strange_03_FS_MTF": "Why not both?",
    "Romantic_03_FS_MTF": "Why should we stop at imagining it?",
    "Strange_04_BB_MTF": "Why would I want to steal the fruits of somebody else's labour?",
    "FunFact_03_BB_MTF": "With all due respect to your grandmother, I don't believe in such superstitions.",
    "Romantic_09_BB_MTF": "With hard work, you can achieve a lot. Maybe not everything, but a lot.",
    "Opinions_01_BB_MTF": "Women are too valuable to die in battle.",
    "SmallTalk_03_FTM": "Work can often get under our skin. What do you do in your spare time?",
    "Compliment_04_SB_MTF": "Work. Work never changes.",
    "Strange_03_FTM": "Would you rather only be able to sing to communicate or dance to get from one place to another?",
    "Strange_02_FTM": "Wouldn't it be great to save a moment, try doing something stupid, see what happens, and then go back in time to that exact moment?",
    "Compliment_11_FTM": "Wow, work definitely serves your muscles well.",
    "Compliment_12_SB_MTF": "Yeah well, some people say I'm like a dog. Not sure if loyalty is the first thing that comes to their minds though.",
    "SmallTalk_05_SB_MTF": "Yeah, I've got one brother. Or so I've heard because he's been behind bars my entire life.",
    "Romantic_10_RM_MTF": "Yeah, me too. I imagine then that you're here. Sometimes I even talk to you.",
    "Romantic_10_SB_MTF": "Yeah, sometimes I want to force you to stay, but I won't. You should be free like a bird.",
    "Romantic_06_SB_MTF": "Yeah, soon we'll be as thick as thieves. But I'm glad we hadn't met earlier. I'm not sure if you would have liked the old me.",
    "SmallTalk_10_RM_MTF": "Yesterday I dreamt about some strange boards on which you could watch other people or animals, and you could control it with your touch.",
    "Gossip_01_FS_MTF": "You better watch out while dancing with cows, then. That makes one more leg to step on your foot.",
    "FunFact_03_SB_MTF": "You can keep your gorgeous hair on your head, my lady. But I wouldn't say no to cookies.",

    "Dobroniega3": "Nadar swears that the rye delivery has already left Rolnica. It’s strange. If it did, the courier should have been back by now. But neither Jarogniewa, nor Nadar had seen him. I should thoroughly check the route from here to Gostovia. Maybe I’ll find some clue at least.",
    "Sambor3-4.1": "Norbert seems like a nice guy. But to be honest after that little witch everyone seems nice. The mightiness of the elixir was of course a load of crap, but that was kind of expected. I need to obtain the necessary ingredients.",
    "Main03": "Oh, my! My uncle's life is much more exciting than I’ve ever imagined! He sounds so extraordinary and fascinating! How I wish I would be able to meet him! To be there, inside of these stories. My life is dull and sad in comparison. All I ever knew was obligations and pain. But Iordan… I must hear more! Uniegost suggested that we should continue tomorrow. Maybe I ought to get some rest. At least if the excitement will let me sleep at all.",
    "Sambor2": "Oh, my, she is as bad as he said! She's even worse than he said! How can so much venom even fit in a little girl like that? I must get on with her task quickly, so I can absolutely never meet with her again.",
    "Main08B": "Okay, I got the scythe back. But retrieving it was much more demanding than Uniegost made it look. Will he pay me back for it? I mean, he is the Castellan… I’m sure he’s going to pay me back. Definitely, he will.",
    "Dobroniega5A": "Okay, it’s time to get back to Dobroniega. I sure hope that the courier will be all right. He probably made this route dozens of times before, and everything was fine. This just shows how fragile life is. Anyway, I should deliver this rye to Dobroniega as soon as possible.",
    "Pregnant_BetterSafeThanSorry_3": "Okay, now it’s time to run back home. I hope it’s not too late!",
    "Main10-11.1": "Okay, that’s absolutely not what I was expecting. The scariest man in the whole Valley is actually a vegetarian and a pacifist. Maybe there still is a chance for me to become an actor? Nevertheless, I’m about to go for some owl hunting. This should be a piece of cake. It’s just an owl… wait, can owls be dangerous?",
    "Main05.2": "Okay, this should be enough clay. There were some interesting wooden figurines lying near the mud. I wonder who made them? Was it Sambor? He doesn’t really strike me as an artistic type. ",
    "Main05.1": "Sambor is less... friendly than he was in my head. Apparently meeting an unknown family member of an old friend is not too appealing for him. He’s an unexpectedly good storyteller though. I must hear the end of his tale! To do so, I need to help him dig out some clay. The shovel’s already in my hand, now I need to find some clay deposits. There should be some right behind his lodge.",
    "Main06": "Sambor told me all about Iordan’s origin and his special skills. He sounds unreal! Like a true hero that you only hear about in legends. I’m honoured to be his kin. But I’d like to know more and more about him and his adventures! I wonder what are the other pack members that Uniegost mentioned like. I’m thrilled just thinking about it all! I must go see Uniegost. Sambor actually wanted me to deliver him a… “knuckle sandwich”. But he can’t really expect me to just punch Uniegost in the face… Right?",
    "Main09": "Sambor was asking for me personally? Well, I’m as good as dead, that’s certain. The only question now is, will he kill me harder if I ignore his call? He probably would. So my best bet is to go to him now and let it end swiftly. I was never too attached to my head anyways.",
    "Main12": "So it appears it was all a practical joke. Sambor looked really furious and tired because of this “owl” but then suddenly burst into laughter. This Wolrad person must be really special. I would not expect Sambor to tolerate anyone toying with him like that. I’m dying to meet Wolrad. Sambor asked me to deliver something to him. I should be back for it tomorrow.",
    "Main01": "So this is it… My uncle is dead. The only goal that led my life for the past few weeks is gone. I didn’t really know him, so his death shouldn’t hurt much, right? Then why does it sting like that? It’s not really sadness but a feeling of… emptiness. Fortunately I’ve met a close friend of Iordan’s - Uniegost. He not only invited me to settle in this beautiful Valley, but also promised to share some stories about my uncle. Now that I have built myself a shelter I can go back to him. He asked me to bring us a couple of beers from the local tavern. It’s supposed to be managed by his wife Dobroniega. I should do just that.",
    "Main23-24.1": "Thankfully the elixir did its job. Kestrel sobered up and managed to speak with me. Despite all those years passing I understand Uniegost’s fascination with her beauty. She really has something unique in her. But all that was clouded by the story of the pack’s disengagement… And it was all because of Iordan! He was the one who broke the rule. Who took a life… I can’t believe it. He really wasn’t as much of a hero as I painted him to be. Was he at all? Or just a narcissist in a search for his limits… Still, the thought of him being murdered sickens me. Even if he had flaws, he aided hundreds of people. Fought for justice. And for Kestrel even to suggest that it could be someone from the pack that contributed to his death…! I need to find this medic and get some answers. Now!",
    "Main20.1": "That son of a bitch! He uses me to be his errand boy when I don’t have any time to waste. Just when I thought he might stop treating me as an intruder, he sent me on a fetch quest. A fetch quest! What is this crap?! Whatever, I’ll get him his bloody vegetables.",
    "Main10-11.3": "That was definitely the strangest “hunt” of my life. But fortunately the “owl” won’t be a problem for Sambor anymore. Maybe getting in his good graces will help me stop soiling myself in his presence. One can only wish…",
    "Main16-17A": "The deed is done. It’s not something I would do for fun, but I honestly don’t understand what all this fuss was about. I need to talk with Wolrad now.",
    "Pregnant_BetterSafeThanSorry_2": "The herbalist had no other choice but to come with me. We just need to collect a few things to be sure we're prepared for anything.",
    "Sambor5": "The little weasel told me to wait until tomorrow. I have a feeling that she’s trying to hoax me on the deal somehow. Well, maybe I’m exaggerating, but something about her makes me doubt every word that comes out of her mouth.",
    "Main13": "The parcel is ready and so am I! It’s time to pay Wolrad a visit. I hope he will share some stories about Iordan with me as well.",
    "Main22.2": "The potion is in my hand. I need to hurry back to Kestrel! Let’s hope it’s not too late...",
    "Main10-11.2": "The sounds of hooting brought me to this man. I see no owls around, just a strange looking fellow. What is he doing here?",
    "Main28": "This is it, everything is ready. Now I need to go and see the medic. The pressure of the unknown is getting to me. I feel like someone has punched through my stomach and is now twisting my guts. It somehow didn’t feel as real before… Now it does. Soon I will know the identity of my uncle’s killer. What will it bring for me? Surely just knowing won’t be enough. I’m afraid of the vengeful path I might send myself on.",
    "Main16-17C.2": "This should do. Wolrad’s family will not be starving on my watch! I need to get back to Amanda.",
    "Main04": "This time unfortunately Uniegost was busy with his responsibilities as the Castellan. There has been a murder. I wonder how often things like that happen here… Either way, he showed me the location of Sambor. Another one of Iordan’s friends. A member of their pack actually. I’m dying to meet him!",
    "Dobroniega1": "Uniegost’s charming wife asked me to see what’s going on with the rye delivery she’s supposed to receive. Jarogniewa is the one responsible for it. I need to speak with her.",
    "Sambor7": "Well, it was… He really… Let’s just leave it at “everybody makes mistakes”. Now back to Fenenna, she cannot weasel out of our deal this time.",
    "Main18": "Wolrad really surprised me with his story. I wouldn’t guess that one of the pack just wore the rest down into accepting him in. But I don’t find this pathetic or silly, on the contrary, I believe it shows real dedication. If you want something in your life, you don’t stop at nothing until you get it. I must talk to Uniegost about Kestrel though. Why didn’t he mention her before? Was he jealous of not being the Iordan’s actual right hand?",
    "Main08A": "“Oh, hi, Racimir! What’s new? What? Are you the most brilliant person in the world? A Riddle Slayer, you say? Well, I would be honoured to warm up in the glare of your glory!” “Please, stop, I just did what any genius would do... Let me go back now to Uniegost with his scythe. The simpler men often strongly depend on their tools.”"

Fortunately, it's no longer in his possession, as it would have surely been emptied to the last drop.\r\n\r\nThe seamster Bratumil turned out to be an old jokester with a unique sense of humour.

    "Ostoya_MSQ_P06_Start": "Bronimir, the master of the elections, was probably close to questioning all of Ostoya's rules and customs when it came up that the elections, after so many turbulences, ended up in a draw. In his last desperate attempt, he decided that the bearer of the honorary resident of Ostoya title, which was specially created for this occasion, should cast the final vote.

Quartermaster is confident that the young guy needs some more time, and he will eventually adapt to his new home and master his craft. Derwan mentioned that he would like to be visited again in some time. A season should be enough.",
    "Intro_MSQ_P03_Start": "Derwan is as vague as he is ominous. Maybe it was just the Quartermaster's poor choice of words, but I definitely shouldn't be ignoring any warnings given in a foreign land. I should keep my eyes and ears wide open. At least for now...",
    "Piastovia_MSQ_P02_Start": "Derwan is in need again. He tasked his apprentice with investigating an argument between two of the townspeople. Knowing Lubos, this might end in the most unpredictable way.",
    "Piastovia_MSQ_P02_DerwanAfterLubosEscort": "Derwan was concerned about the money that Lubos was supposedly carrying. He mentioned that one of the people most eagerly waiting for the delivery was the blacksmith, Gorazd. He should be informed first about the lost goods.",
    "Ostoya_MSQ_P03_Start": "Elections in Ostoya are still pending. There are three villagers who refuse to vote. Bronimir can't intervene directly, as this would be considered a manipulation of the election.

    "Piastovia_MSQ_P02_DerwanReport": "Favourable treatment of Lubos is not a mystery anymore. Derwan made a promise to a dying comrade in arms to take care of his son if he ever needed aid. Knowing now how seriously the Quartermaster takes his duties and oaths, he won't give up easily on the lad. What's more, it may also be a way for him to redeem his past sins. Still stubbornly believing in Lubos, he set him on another mission, this time to retrieve a load of goods from an unlicensed source outside of the town.",
    "Piastovia_MSQ_P02_Eavesdropping": "Finally, both Lubos and Derwan met eye-to-eye and talked. It seems that Derwan was too focused on just fulfilling his oath to actually care about his apprentice's needs. On the other side, Lubos showed his impudence and used Derwan's tolerance to the extent that his master's patience reached its limit. It looks like the lad is jobless from now on, and Derwan considers his promise to the young man's father fulfilled.",

    "Klonica_MSQ_P02_EndAfterDebris": "Finding even the slightest new trace of Wojmir's past activity would satisfy Jaropelk. That's why he was stunned when the actual burial site of his late father was found. The lad needed some time alone and stated that the axe should be shown to Niedan, the woodcutter's leader. The man should be able to say something more about it.",
    "Klonica_MSQ_P01_GoingToSleep": "Fortunately, Jaropelk was escorted to his bed safe and sound. He should rest for some time until he's back to normal. After all, he proposed an expedition to the forest. It would be wise to prepare some food and water for the scout.",

He wants to channel all his negative emotions into the most drastic of measures – the assassination of our king. He needs to be stopped, no matter what. Looking into his scribblings that he studies so relentlessly should give some idea about the next step to take.",

    "Ostoya_MSQ_P03_GniewkoVariantC": "Gniewko is still afraid to go back home, but he agreed to change his mind if presented with a proper weapon to defend himself from threats on the road. A good crossbow should make a bandit think twice before deciding to rob a traveller.",
    "Ostoya_MSQ_P03_GniewkoVariantB": "Gniewko is still afraid to go back home, but he agreed to change his mind if presented with a trophy worthy of a true hunter. This would prove him that the land is well protected and bandits fear the locals.",
    "Ostoya_MSQ_P03_GniewkoVariantA": "Gniewko is still afraid to go back home, but he agreed to change his mind if the population of local bandits decreased. It's time for some head hunting.",

    "Skauki_MSQ_P02A_Waclawa": "It is important to find another one of Otker's collaborators, Purt, as he's in possession of a very important document. The first place to look would be his sister's Waclawa place in Skauki.",
    "Ostoya_MSQ_P01_LudomirBeforeInspection": "It seems that the fisherman Myslidar has gone missing. He is Ludomir's opponent in the upcoming election for the village's warden. The ceremony can't be held before the current leader learns what happened to his rival. He wishes the islet to be scoured in order to find any clues about Myslidar's last moments or plans before his disappearance.",
    "Piastovia_MSQ_P02_Lubos": "It seems that the two quarrelling men were encouraged to resolve their problem in a duel. One of them didn't even pick up the weapon and was most likely badly wounded. It would be good to check on him at his place.",
    "Skauki_MSQ_P02A_Weapons": "It turned out that Otker is planning on assassinating the king for all of his previous wrongdoings. He needs help preparing the mission. The first thing on the list is getting the weapon supply that arrived lately at Piastovia's storage.",
    "Klonica_MSQ_P03_Start": "It turned out that the rusty axe once belonged to Niedan. The leader of the woodcutters was surprised to see it and immediately burst into rage when it wasn't given back to him. It belongs now to Jaropelk, and he should decide what to do with it. The young hunter should learn about the woodcutter's strange reaction and the axe's origin.",
    "Skauki_MSQ_P02B_FollowBert": "It would be best to speak with him alone in a quiet place outside the village.",
    "Skauki_MSQ_P02B_OtkerEavesdrop": "It would be best to witness the conversation, just in case it gets too heated.\t\t",
    "Ostoya_MSQ_P06_Vote": "It's done. The chosen warden should start his new term next season. Let there be hope that the future elections will go much smoother.",
    "Klonica_MSQ_P02_BeforeCave": "It's time to explore the cave that used to be a contraband hiding place while Jaropelk is searching its surroundings.",
    "Klonica_MSQ_P05_JaropelkPrzedWerdyktem": "Jaropelk couldn't believe the former leader of the village wasn't his real father. After all these years of contemplating Wojrmir's past and looking for his traits in himself, the young hunter denied accepting that he could share blood with someone like Niedan. After hearing some final opinions, the young hunter decided to take matters into his own hands. Klonica may not be the same place it used to be. A new leader emerges.",
    "Klonica_MSQ_P02_BeforeBandits": "Jaropelk is anxious to learn if there's anything he could have missed in the ruined cottage, but the building is guarded by bandits. It looks like it's going to be a fight or a stealthy game of sneaking in the shadows. Either way, the building has to be searched.",
    "Klonica_MSQ_P01_Cheese": "Jaropelk looks up to his father's achievements as a hunter. The lad would like to once again pay visit to the places which where important to Wojmir, but the problem is the increasing bandit threat in the area. He is eager to scout the woods with you. Before he continues his story, Jaropelk wishes to get his hands on some of the famous woodcutter's cheese. It should be lying somewhere in the lumberjack's outpost north of Klonica. The lad's hunger must be really killing him...",
    "Klonica_MSQ_P02_AfterWakeup": "Jaropelk wasn't quite back to himself yet, but after overhearing his mother's complaints, he decided to set off for the forest without any delay. It's obvious that his mother won't be very fond of this journey.",
    "Klonica_MSQ_P01_Wine": "Jaropelk, the heir to Klonica village, shared his doubts about him leading the village one day. It seems that his mother cares more about his future role than he does. The lad also talked about his deceased father, Wojmir, who went missing in a blizzard years ago. The reminiscences encouraged Jaropelk to raise another toast, this time to his dad. Apparently there is a dozen wine bottles lying around, perfect for this purpose.",
    "Ostoya_MSQ_P05_BiezprawFinal": "Learning that the young boy was training to be a fisherman and even creating his own gear took Biezpraw off guard. The old fisherman suddenly realised his mistake and regretted his decision to drive the young one away. In the end, he stated that he would keep his promise and toss the vote. It seems that this might not be the end of the story between the two after all.",
    "Piastovia_MSQ_P02_LubosAfterEavesdropping_1": "Lubos decided to leave the Oxbow to pursue a military life under a local lord. He wants to take his chances and ask Derwan for a recommendation so that his offer will at least be heard by anyone seeking mercenaries or guards. That sounds crazy, but if that's the way to get rid of the lad, Derwan might consider this request.",
    "Piastovia_MSQ_P02_LubosAfterEavesdropping_2": "Lubos decided to stay in the Oxbow to try his hand at protecting the town against the rising bandit threat. That's finally some rational thinking from the lad. If he ever wishes to pursue a military life, that's the fastest way to do it. If he proves to be useful, he will be able to expect fine recommendations for serving in Piastovia's defence. And who knows? Maybe one day Derwan will decide to forgive him for his mischievous acts.",
    "Piastovia_MSQ_P02_LubosAfterBugoslawa": "Lubos does not have a shred of respect for anyone. The lives of other people don't matter to him. The young man thinks only of his own selfish goals and will not hesitate to commit the most heinous acts to get what he wants. On top of that, he tried to justify his behaviour by comparing himself to his master, who was allegedly also a difficult young man years ago. Somehow, this is hard to believe. It's ridiculous. It's time to report it to Derwan.",
    "Piastovia_MSQ_P01_LubosGotDelievery_3": "Lubos had a delivery list from the very beginning. The problem is that the young man doesn't know how to read, and he didn't bother to mention that to his master, who provided him with it. Having been introduced to the details of the list, Lubos was tasked with delivering the supplies again on his own. It's time to report to Derwan.",
    "Piastovia_MSQ_P01_LubosGotDelievery_1": "Lubos had a delivery list from the very beginning. The problem is that the young man doesn't know how to read, and he didn't bother to mention that to his master, who provided him with it. Lubos was assured that all four deliveries would reach their proper owners.",
    "Piastovia_MSQ_P01_LubosGotDelievery_2": "Lubos had a delivery list from the very beginning. The problem is that the young man doesn't know how to read, and he didn't bother to mention that to his master, who provided him with it. The delivery was split so that the townspeople wouldn't have to wait anymore for their supplies. Lubos was ensured that the onions and hammers would reach their proper owners.",
    "Piastovia_MSQ_P02_LubosAfterEscort": "Lubos seems to be sick. He has gone back home to get well. The meeting place he pointed out before leaving will have to be reached without him.",
    "Piastovia_MSQ_P01_LubosAfterTalking": "Lubos was clearly pleased that someone was doing his dirty work for him, but at the same time, he showed no appreciation for the help. He decided to refill the jug of wine and find a way to clean the ruined dress. The other half of the items to be collected again are onions and wooden hammers.",
    "Skauki_MSQ_P02A_OtkerAfterPurtBody": "Luckily, the plans have been found in one piece. It's time to deliver them to Otker.                ",
    "Ostoya_MSQ_P01_LudomirAfterInspection": "Ludomir doesn't understand Myslidar's concerns. The village is properly maintaining its resources and seeks no quarrel with anyone. The warden suggests speaking to the fisherman's closest neighbours to learn further hints of his whereabouts.",
    "Piastovia_MSQ_P02_Markuslaw": "Markuslaw decided to take matters into his own hands. He accuses Osiebor of stealing wine and seducing his daughter, although he did not see the thief's face. Who could do such a thing?",
    "Ostoya_MSQ_P03_Mironiega": "Mironiega blames Myslidar for making her husband paranoid about the bandit threat. Gniewko supposedly ran to Piastovia in fear that Ostoya was going to be sacked soon. Mironiega would gladly welcome him back since he left a lot of his chores unfinished and she has no intention of doing them for him.",
    "Intro_P03_StrongerMeasures": "My voice in the Oxbow becomes more and more influential. As my position in the land grows, I start to see even more clearly how poorly the Oxbow is managed. It might be time for some action.",
    "Ostoya_MSQ_P02_MyslidarPotionOfSoberity": "Myslidar is finally back to his senses. He told a story about how he almost fell into the hands of bandits but eventually found refuge in the cave and discovered this hermitage below the waterfall. The man admits to having been under the influence of poisonous berries. Now that his mind is clear, he plans to come back to Ostoya for the election. The warden of the village should learn that the fisherman is safe and sound.",
    "Skauki_MSQ_P01A_Nasiebor": "Nasiebor owes Dalton some coins. Getting the debt back will result in Dalton leaving his post.",
    "Klonica_MSQ_P04_PezyrkaPrzedPotionem": "Niedan's former wife didn't seem surprised that the woodcutter turned out to be capable of murder. She shared some memories about the harsh relationship that she had with the man. Pezyrka also mentioned some old papers. She asked for some water for her potion and in the meantime she promised to look for them.",
    "Ostoya_MSQ_P04_PickUpDress": "Niemila is irritated by Radomila's overall behaviour, especially her levity. But the woman seems to care about the girl and her wellbeing.",
    "Skauki_MSQ_P02A_PiastoviaBoard": "One of the travellers passing through was telling about an unusual notice seen in Piastovia. Supposedly, the document was sent directly from the castle. That's something that Otker could have been involved in. It would be wise to check it out.",
    "Piastovia_MSQ_P02_Osiebor": "Osiebor is recovering in the sick house under Sedowin's care. The wounded man, with great effort, explained that he was surprised by his abuser. He and Markuslaw were always on good terms as friends. Osiebor was lured out of his house by Markuslaw and Lubos and was suddenly attacked just after being called a traitor. He has no hard feelings towards his unexpected opponent and wishes him to be informed about that.",
    "Skauki_MSQ_P02A_RebellionStart": "Otker and his rebellion now have everything they need to follow through with their plan. All there is left to do is wait to hear the news of their success.",
    "Skauki_MSQ_P02B_OtkerEscort": "Otker finally wants to confront his father. This is something that should've happened a long time ago. He should be accompanied on his trip to Skauki for safety measures. Who knows what those two are able to do in the heat of an argument...",
    "Skauki_MSQ_P02_Otker": "Otker's location has been revealed. It's a proper time for a conversation with him.",
    "Piastovia_MSQ_P02_DerwanAfterGorazd": "Probably no one in Piastovia has ever witnessed good old Derwan so full of anger when he learned that Lubos shipped the goods on his own. Treason is something he despises the most. The Quartermaster set off to check the storage that is next to his house.",
    "Ostoya_MSQ_P04_RadomilaAfterDress": "Radomila has more urgent tasks. She's in need of vases and honeycombs, however strange this combination might look. The girl notes that she would go herself but cannot leave the village at the moment. She adds that her dress should be ready for pick up shortly.",
    "Ostoya_MSQ_P04_Start": "Radomila is eagerly preparing herself for something and refuses to vote until her chores are finished. She isn't concerned at all by the delay in the voting event. The girl asks for help with the delivery of her dress to the local seamstress.",
    "Ostoya_MSQ_P04_RadomilaAfterLudomir": "Radomila is handling the disappointment quite well. The girl assured that she'd be fine and that she'd use her voting stone soon.",
    "Intro_MSQ_P02_Start": "Sedowin sure is peculiar, but his skills as a medic are undeniable. May he always be in good health himself. The Castellan of Oxbow - Mirogod - wishes to speak to me. It wouldn't be wise to ignore a direct bidding of the person in charge.",
    "Skauki_MSQ_P02A_GilbertDeadEnd": "So this is it. Otker and his men are dead. Even though some might've called them terrorists and renegades, they were truly freedom fighters trying to make a change for the better. At least that's what they believed in. Nonetheless, their deaths are a tragedy. The only consolation is that they weren't recognised, so the king's wrath will not be coming for anyone in the Oxbow. In order to properly mourn their demise, it would be best to go and see Gilbert.",
    "Intro_P03_BetterOxbow": "Some time has passed since my arrival in this land. People seem to get more used to my person running around the Oxbow, and starting a new, thiriving settlement. Maybe it's time for me to influence some real change around here.",
    "Skauki_MSQ_P02A_Body": "Supposedly, Purt should be somewhere by the river.",
    "Klonica_MSQ_P04_Start": "The barber surgeon confirmed that the bones belonged to a middle-aged man. Deep cutting and blunt marks suggest murder and point to a certain type of chopping weapon. Jaropelk should receive these news, fast.",
    "Intro_MSQ_P0T_Start": "The barber surgeon said that a list of a few simple tasks awaits me at the table in front of the sick house. The exercises are supposed to help me regain full strength after the injuries.",
    "Piastovia_MSQ_P02_Gorazd": "The blacksmith was surprised by the news about the lost goods. According to him, the supplies have already flooded the local market. What's more, Lubos was spotted hanging around the supplies as they arrived. Did Lubos know that the supplies were already gone at the meeting spot? Were they already in town? Derwan must be warned about this treachery.",
    "Ostoya_MSQ_P05_ZbywojAfterDobrochna": "The boy will leave Biezpraw's neighbourhood. It turned out that he observed and mimicked the old fisherman, wanting to become one himself. He even gave away some makeshift fishing equipment of unknown origin. Could it be stolen? The grumpy old man should learn that his problem is gone.",
    "Ostoya_MSQ_P05_Zbywoj": "The case seems to be way more serious than the fisherman claimed since the stalker is no monster... but a child! After all, this species is the hardest to tame and deal with. The boy refuses to leave his playing spot until he comes to terms with his sister, Dobrochna. Maybe the old fisherman will snap out of his delusion when he learns why Zbywoj spends so much time away from his family's homestead.",
    "Klonica_MSQ_P02_CampInCave": "The cave was inhabited not long so ago, but now it has turned into a wolves' lair.",
    "Skauki_MSQ_P02A_Bout": "The crate with weapons is ready to be delivered to Otker's associate.",
    "Ostoya_MSQ_P05_AfterDoll": "The doll went through some rough times after being chewed a bit by various wildlife, but overall, she's safe and sound in Dobrochna's hands now. The girl forgave her brother for losing it, but she's pretty sure this won't be enough to bring him back home. To her mind, he has another reason to play far from home, and that's fishing.",
    "Skauki_MSQ_P01_OtkerHouse": "The door to the backroom of Otker's house is guarded by a strange man. What's so precious on the other side of that door?",
    "Klonica_MSQ_P04_Zemko": "The eerie merchant Zemko mentioned that Slawa had gone north. It would be wise to check the landmarks explored earlier with Jaropelk in the northern forest.",
    "Ostoya_MSQ_P03_Start0": "The election of Ostoya's new leader should start soon. Perhaps it would be worth visiting Bronimir?",
    "Piastovia_MSQ_P02_Boguslawa": "The farmer, Osiebor, was nowhere near his house. His wife had no idea of his state or the duel that had taken place. Boguslawa didn't know anything about his whereabouts but she said that he never ventured far from the town. He must be somewhere nearby.",
    "Klonica_MSQ_P02_DialogueAboutFather": "The first spot was an inconspicuous place. It's where Jaropelk's father first confided in him, telling him how eagerly he awaited for his son to be born. There's nothing special there but some fond memories of a parent-son relationship.",
    "Ostoya_MSQ_P01_Mironiega": "The fisherman's neighbours find it odd that the reclusive Myslidar started leaving his islet more often and bringing various resources back to it. They also point out that he became very concerned about the bandit threat. Both of them suggested going south, as he usually headed in this direction before getting out of their sight.",
    "Klonica_MSQ_P04_PezyrkaPoPotionie": "The herbalist recalled a special visit that Wojmir paid her just a day before his disappearance during the notorious blizzard. The man was looking for a remedy for infertility. The same one that he and his wife had used years ago before Jaropelk was born. After learning that no such thing existed, the hunter stormed out of the herbalist's hut. This story and the parchment snippets Pezyrka offered show that there may have been a third person involved in Slawa's relationship.",
    "Skauki_MSQ_P02A_OtkerAfterWeapons": "The job is done. Otker would definitely like to hear about it.",
    "Ostoya_MSQ_P05_Start0": "The last person to delay casting a vote is old fisherman Biezpraw. It is worth checking what his delay is due to.",
    "Skauki_MSQ_P02B_TomaszLeave": "The letter's found and ready to be brought back to Tomasz.",
    "Intro_MSQ_P0T_FoundList": "The list has been found. Now it's time to complete the tasks. Should be easy enough.",
    "Piastovia_MSQ_P01_Drogomir": "The local builder, Drogomir, mistakenly got a hold of a jug of wine. The man decided to keep it for himself since you don't get chances like this every day. Unfortunately, the jug attracted the interest of his neighbours, who constantly knocked on his door wanting a sip of this exquisite wine, leaving it half empty. Fortunately, it's no longer in his possession, as it would have surely been emptied to the last drop.",
    "Ostoya_MSQ_P01_StrangeRocks": "The man who lives on this Ostoya's islet must have been expecting something bad to happen. He's been gathering various types of resources as if preparing for a natural disaster or some kind of attack or siege. The only items that stand out are the green carved stones. It would be a waste of time to carve symbols on rocks meant to be thrown at someone. Ludomir should learn about these revelations.",
    "Intro_MSQ_P01_Start": "The memories and the nightmares clash to determine which ones are more haunting. But the battle cannot be settled. Nor can any of them be trusted. My head hurts so much I can barely see straight. Does the pain come from the screams? Thousands of agonising shrieks echoing in my skull... What happened? Brief glimpses keep flashing before my eyes... I'm not sure if I want to focus on them. If I want to remember... I need to leave. I need to breathe! What is this place, anyway? Someone has clearly taken care of me. Tended to my wounds. We should talk. He might know more than me... Wait. Is that a good thing?",
    "Ostoya_MSQ_P01_Start": "The new warden election is coming up in Ostoya village. The master of ceremonies, Bronimir, mentioned that the event faces some problems, but he wouldn't reveal any details until he was sure no one would overhear the conversation. The man is heading to meet his brother, who's the current warden of Ostoya.",
    "Skauki_MSQ_P02A_Elric": "The next task from Otker is finding Elric, who lives in the swamp. He's supposed to have a special item prepared for the rebellion.",
    "Ostoya_MSQ_P05_Start": "The old fisherman's mind plays tricks on him. He clearly can't determine what's real and what's not anymore. Being prone to seeing mysterious beings starts to be a common thing for fishermen from this village. There's nothing left to do but check the old man's surroundings for any signs of stalking monsters.",
    "Skauki_MSQ_P02B_Demotivate": "The only thing readable from Otker's notes was a password that he presumably uses to contact other members of the rebellion. That's something to start with. In order to put a spoke in Otker's wheel, it will be necessary to discourage his associates from taking part in his mission.",
    "Skauki_MSQ_P02A_OtkerCocktail": "The order is complete. Now it can be delivered back to Otker.",
    "Klonica_MSQ_P02_AfterZemko": "The pin received from the hermits turns out to be a lost property of Wojmir's. Jaropelk insists on searching the pile of rocks where it was allegedly found.",
    "Ostoya_MSQ_P02_Magnus": "The problem of the pouchers is solved. It's time to inform Myslidar that his passage home won't be disturbed.",
    "Klonica_MSQ_P05_Start": "The relationships between the members of the leading family of Klonica are more complicated than anyone could imagine. The thick layer of lies and crimes deprived them of normal lives, even years after Wojmir's death. The real victim is Jaropelk, who was unaware of the village elders' affairs. The young hunter should not only know the truth about what happened in the woods with Wojmir those few years ago, but also learn about the uncertain circumstances of his conceiving.",
    "Piastovia_MSQ_P01_Bratumil": "The seamster Bratumil turned out to be an old jokester with a unique sense of humour. He used the mistakenly obtained wooden hammers as firewood. None were left to take to their rightful owner.",
    "Skauki_MSQ_P02B_GilbertAliveEnd": "The time has come to go and see Gilbert again. It's interesting what has become of his relationship with Otker. Sometimes truth acts like a powerful whirlwind. It may lead to a complete disaster or be an impulse for regrowth. But nothing is ever the same again after the havoc it has created.",
    "Piastovia_MSQ_P01_Start": "The town's Quartermaster, Derwan, needs a favour. His new apprentice seems to have a problem with delivering some supplies to the townspeople. His master does not want this obvious example of incompetence to spread among the locals. Derwan wishes that someone from outside of Piastovia should look into it.",
    "Skauki_MSQ_P01_OtkerHouseClear": "The way to the Otker's back room is clear. It's time to see what secrets it holds.",
    "Ostoya_MSQ_P02_Start": "The young fisherman was found in a hermitage south of Ostoya, under a high waterfall, surrounded by wild animals. His animal companions seem to be very calm despite the presence of people. Myslidar is speaking to rocks, plants, and other creatures. The man might have poisoned himself with a deadly nightshade. There's not much that can be done about his state at this moment, but it might be worth it to solve his other problem. Myslidar states that the way back to the village is blocked by some individuals.",
    "Piastovia_MSQ_P01_Lubos": "The young guy doesn't see any problem with his actions. Lubos wasn't much interested in trying to fix his mistakes. To his mind, people should be content with what they received and not whine. There's nothing much to do but talk to the townspeople personally and see what a mess he has made.",
    "Klonica_MSQ_P04_JaropelkAfterSedowin": "The young hunter decided to confront Niedan, whom he suspected of murdering his father. It would be wise to keep him company in case anything gets out of control.",
    "Klonica_MSQ_P01_Start": "The young hunter is really eager to talk and raise a toast. How could anyone reject that kind of offer? The hunter's outpost is just across the river to the west.",
    "Ostoya_MSQ_P05_BiezprawAfterZbywoj": "The young kid belongs to the warden's family. Biezpraw states that Zbywoj can't be shooed away just like that. The old fisherman is afraid of the consequences of that kind of act. He suggests talking to the boy's sister and learning what is their quarrel about.",
    "Ostoya_MSQ_P04_RadomilaWithDress": "The young woman wishes the carefully selected items to be brought to a special meeting place. She stated that the wine jug should be placed on the left side and the juice flagon on the right side of the meeting stone. Flower vases are to stand in the back.",
    "Ostoya_MSQ_P02_MyslidarAfterMagnus": "There is no way to reason with the man in this state. Myslidar must be treated with a cure of some sort. Otherwise, talking with him is a waste of time.",
    "Klonica_MSQ_P02_AfterBandits": "There was a rusty axe hidden in the cottage. The weapon has a unique marking on its head and seems to be old. Jaropelk was puzzled about how it could end up there since it resembles the ones used by Klonica's woodcutters.",
    "Piastovia_MSQ_P02_MissingSupplies": "There was no middleman present at the exchange meeting spot. The goods were looted, and the place was already overrun by bandits.",
    "Piastovia_MSQ_P02_BoguslawaAfterInvestigation": "There's one name that comes to mind... Lubos. The apprentice boasted about a fair lady who would do laundry for him and a hidden collection of wine not so long ago. He must have done it again...",
    "Ostoya_MSQ_P01_MironiegaCaveEntrance": "This cave might be the fastest way south. It would be worth a try to check if it has an exit.",
    "Skauki_MSQ_P02B_BertLeave": "This cave seems perfect for the difficult conversation ahead.",
    "Ostoya_MSQ_P01_MironiegaCaveExit": "This cavern was the source of the green voting stones used by Myslidar. There is no doubt that he used to come here to mine them. The river is visible again. It would be wise to continue along it to the south.",
    "Klonica_MSQ_P03_JaropelkAfterNiedan": "This might be one of the strangest deliveries. The remains have to be examined by Sedowin, the barber surgeon. Jaropelk wants to be sure they belong to his late father and, if possible, learn what caused his passing.",
    "Skauki_MSQ_P02A_ElricWisentHunt": "This should be enough for Elric's concoction.",
    "Klonica_MSQ_P02_Start": "This was an unexpected encounter with the village leader, Slawa. The woman was furious. It seems she doesn't approve of Jaropelk's drinking habits. Her other accusation was unnecessary confusing her son by bringing back the memories of his deceased father, Wojmir. She really wishes her son would move on at all costs.",
    "Skauki_MSQ_P02B_Tomasz": "Tomasz seems to be the most sensitive and fragile of the bunch. Maybe it will be possible to sway him away from this terrible plan.",
    "Skauki_MSQ_P02A_BodyFound": "Unfourtunately, Purt was murdered, and all of his belongings are missing. There's no way of telling if the attack was targeted. Maybe the killer is somewhere nearby? It's crucial to find Purt's stolen document.",
    "Ostoya_MSQ_P04_LudomirEavesdrop": "What initially looked like an affair was actually set to be just a trade deal for an unborn child between a couple and a young woman. It seems that in the end, one side of the transaction got too invested in the other short-term partner, but the feeling isn't mutual. After spending some time alone, Radomila should be checked on.",
    "Intro_MSQ_P02_Derwan": "Whatever nice could be said about Sedowin definitely couldn't be said about Mirogod. The young Castellan is a textbook example of a brat. An utterly annoying, unbearable, indigestion-inducing, fist-clenching, spoiled brat. I am to speak with his Quartermaster now. Let's find out what Derwan is like.",
    "Ostoya_MSQ_P02_Ludomir": "When Ludomir realised that his rival is alive, he didn't say much, but in the end, he was relieved that the election can be held. It is set to begin the next season.",
    "Skauki_MSQ_P02B_Wilhelm": "Wilhelm comes off as the most experienced and straight-thinking. He might be convinced by some reasonable arguments."
